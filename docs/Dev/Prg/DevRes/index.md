+ **AI Tools:**

    [OpenAI(ChatGPT)](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login)

    A chat bot that you can ask anything, and get an excellent response.

    It's great for:

    -> Writing code for you / debugging your code
    -> Inspiring topics to write about
    -> Writing for you. It does 80% of the work, you do 20%.
    -> So. Much. More.

    [MidJourney](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/)

    A text-to-image generator. You "imagine" something and.. 30 seconds later, like MAGIC, you see a visual representation of it.

    It's great for:

    -> Concept Art
    -> Replacing stock images
    -> Logo Design
    -> HAVING FUN

    Images made by MidJourney

    [Mem](https://get.mem.ai/)

    Mem is a self described, self-organizing workspace. It seems extremely powerful. I say seems b/c I have only just started using it myself.

    As someone who struggles with organization, I am extremely excited to see what AI can do to help.

    [Hypefury](https://hypefury.com/)

    Hypefury will help schedule your tweets, but will also give you inspiration for what to tweet.

    It doesn't write for you (and I wouldn't want it to), but it's insanely helpful. If you want to up your Twitter game, Hypefury is a must imo.

    [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/)

    This is actually my favourite. It's SO simple.

    You start typing and it helps make your writing more succinct. Hemingway is one of the greatest writers of all time, and he used short, digestible sentences.

    Hemingway helps you do that too.
