## Markdown Essentials

### Emphasis

```markdown
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

### Lists

```markdown
**Task Lists**

- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
    - [x] Subtask A
    - [ ] Subtask B
- [ ] Task 3

**Ordered and Unordered Lists**

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
1. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use four here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use *two trailing spaces*.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

### Links

There are two ways to create links.

```markdown
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com){target=_blank}

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage"){target=_blank}

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/){target=_blank}.

```markdown
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ` ``` `, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```text

  ```js
  var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
  alert(s);
  ```

  ```python
  s = "Python syntax highlighting"
  print s
  ```

  ```
  No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
  But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
  ```

```

print s

### Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM.

```markdown
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

### Blockquotes

```markdown
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
```

### Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

### Horizontal Rule

```markdown
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

### Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit <kbd>&#8996;</kbd> (Enter) once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

```text
Here's a line for us to start with.


This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
```

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

!!! note

    In GFM line breaks there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.

### YouTube Videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```html
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```markdown
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```

#### About YouTube video thumbnails

Each YouTube video has four generated images. They are predictably formatted as follows:

```text
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/0.jpg
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/1.jpg
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/2.jpg
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/3.jpg
```

The first one in the list is a full size image and others are thumbnail images. The default thumbnail image (i.e., one of `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, `3.jpg`) is:

```text
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/default.jpg
```

There are also other versions of the thumbnail:

```text
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/hqdefault.jpg       <!-- high quality thumbnail -->
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/mqdefault.jpg       <!-- medium quality tumbnail -->
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/sddefault.jpg       <!-- standard definition thumbnail -->
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<insert-youtube-video-id-here>/maxresdefault.jpg   <!-- maximum resolution thumbnail -->
```

!!! note

    All of the above URLs are available over HTTP too. Additionally, the slightly shorter hostname `i3.ytimg.com` works in place of `img.youtube.com` in the example URLs above.
